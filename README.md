# Demo Shopping Cart App
This project demonstrates how to make shopping cart app using redux-toolkit.

## Following libraries are used in this project
1) reactjs/toolkit
2) react-redux
3) axios

## For demo api, I have used fake api from dummyjson 
`https://dummyjson.com/products` \
save it as 'products.json' and \
copy and paste this file inside project folder. Remember, this file shouldn't inside src folder. instead it should be outside of the src folder along with `package.json`

## To get data you have to run following command
`json-server <filename>.json -p <portnumber>` \
rename <filename> with your actual filname and <portnumber> with your prefered port number. e.g. 8080, 8081, etc.

Then run following command to start your app.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
